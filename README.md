# Statement of purpose for PhD in Physics

This is a thoery of physics I'd like to test as much as possible in the pursue of a degree in particle physics. The background in an engineering statement "What you see is what you get" and an exploration of my own conciousness, therefore my human existance.

The thoery comes down to two statments so far.
1. There is a fourth spacial dimension that is instantanout (timelesss)
2. Einstient Theory of relativity only applies to photons

The more expermenal physics I undersatnd the more I can exapand on this theory.

With a Bachlor of Science in Computer Engineering from Univerty of California, Santa Barbara and some undergradute research in nanotechnology I just don't have the background to back up or deny this thoery.

What I can say is the first statement allows orbitals to actaully orbit around the nucleus.

THe second may give us the abilitty out speed the photon and make space travel something non-generational.

Either one gives me hope for a new age in space travel and possible new age in computing power.
