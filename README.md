# Statement of purpose for PhD in Physics

This is a thoery of physics I'd like to test as much as possible in the pursue of a degree in particle physics. The background in an engineering statement "What you see is what you get" and an exploration of my own conciousness, therefore my human existance.

The thoery comes down to two statments so far.
1. There is a fourth spacial dimension that is instantanout (timelesss)
2. Einstein Theory of relativity only applies to photons

The more expermenal physics I undersatnd the more I can exapand on this theory.

With a Bachlor of Science in Computer Engineering from Univerty of California, Santa Barbara and some undergradute research in nanotechnology I just don't have the background to back up or deny this thoery.

What I can say is the first statement allows orbitals to actually orbit around the nucleus.

The second may give us the ability out speed the photon and make space travel something non-generational.

Either one gives me hope for a new age in space travel and possible new age in computing power.

The scariest equation Einstein ever wrote is beautiful.

```
E=MC^2
```

Energy is equal to the Mass of an object times the speed of starlight squared.

But it dropped two atomic bombs where my grandfathers were involved in both sides of the affair.

This is where, I get philosophical. Consciousness must be some form of energy, because I am singular, yet my brain is a mass of cells interconnected allowing me to think, remember, and do all the things a neurologist studies.
My guess its my singular consciousness exist in the 4th dimension using the body of the lower 3 and the is myself.

Lucky for me, it can never be proven as no one can probe this dimension. We just see electrons enter and immediate exit it. It causes the spookiness of quantum physics. Or at least I hope so.
